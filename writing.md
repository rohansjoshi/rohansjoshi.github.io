[Derived Intersections in Quasi-Smooth Affine Schemes](/files/derivedintersections.pdf), paper based on research on computations in derived algebraic geometry at the 2019 Cornell SPUR program, under [Harrison Chen](https://chenhi.github.io). Co-written with Lin An and [Felipe Castellano-Macías](https://fcastellanomacias.github.io).

[The Riemann Hypothesis for Curves over Finite Fields](/files/rhforcurves.pdf), an expository paper on the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis in the function field setting, a problem that was solved by André Weil in the 1940s. To date, it represents the most solid progress towards the original Riemann hypothesis. I explain how this problem can be interpreted as a statement about algebraic curves and fits into the larger picture of the Weil conjectures. This was my final paper for Math 254A: Number Theory at UC Berkeley, taught by Sug Woo Shin.

I occasionally blog at [Arithmetic Variety](https://ocf.io/rohanjoshi).
